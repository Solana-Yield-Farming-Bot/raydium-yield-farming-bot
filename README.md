## Overview

This repository presents documentation and resources for the **Solana Yield Farming Bot**, a Windows-first automation tool built around Raydium AMM farms. The system is engineered to locate attractive farming opportunities, quantify and mitigate associated risks (impermanent loss, liquidity depth, token health), and automate the operational lifecycle â€” funding, staking, harvesting, compounding, and exiting â€” according to explicit user-configured policies.

The project prioritizes operational safety and transparency. It supplies architectural guidance, simulation/backtest tooling, strategy templates, and operational checklists suitable for both research and controlled live deployment.

**Mandatory security & compliance advisories**

- Do not paste private keys into arbitrary applications or web pages. Use external wallet providers, hardware wallets, or remote signing services that retain keys off-host.
- Validate workflows using devnets, test environments, or ephemeral wallets with minimal funds before scaling.
- Yield farming and DeFi invest carries financial and technical risks. This repository provides tools and guidance, not financial counsel. Users must comply with regional laws and protocol rules.
- The project excludes any content that promotes market manipulation, front-running, or other illicit practices.

## Primary capabilities

- **Raydium-native connectors** â€” direct support for Raydium pools, farms, and associated AMM routes.
- **Opportunity discovery** â€” continuous scanning and ranking of pools by APY, TVL, recent volume, fee profile, and slippage sensitivity.
- **Risk analytics** â€” automated impermanent loss projections, volatility-based exposure scoring, and token safety flags (audit references, mint anomalies).
- **Automated lifecycle management** â€” configurable pipelines for deposit, stake, harvest, auto-compound, and withdrawal actions.
- **Strategy presets** â€” preconfigured conservative, moderate, and aggressive farming strategies with adjustable parameters.
- **Historical replay & backtesting** â€” simulate farming outcomes over historical price and liquidity traces with fee/slippage models.
- **Paper mode (full simulation)** â€” end-to-end emulation of on-chain actions without spending real funds.
- **Secure signing workflows** â€” recommended integration patterns for wallet adapters, hardware devices, and remote signers; no plaintext key storage.
- **Pre-execution safety gates** â€” slippage caps, estimated fee ceilings, whitelist checks, and multi-source RPC verification.
- **Comprehensive audit logs** â€” immutable records of signals, transactions, and reconciliation steps.
- **Alerting & monitoring** â€” email/telegram/webhook alerts for harvests, threshold breaches, or failed operations.
- **Scheduling & maintenance** â€” cron-like job scheduling for harvest cycles and maintenance windows.
- **Extensible plugin model** â€” add new AMMs, pools, or analytics modules without touching core logic.
- **Config-centric operations** â€” all operational parameters reside in version-controlled configuration files (secrets excluded).
- **Operator separation & access control** â€” recommended role-based workflows for teams and auditors.

## Process flow (conceptual)

This section outlines the high-level pipeline used by the application to select and manage farming positions on Raydium.

1. **Discovery & ingestion**  
   - Aggregate on-chain pool metadata, reserves, reward schedules, and off-chain indicators such as volume and token metadata.
   - Produce a sanitized candidate set by excluding low-liquidity or unvetted tokens.

2. **Scoring & modeling**  
   - Compute expected APY, model fees, estimate impermanent loss using historical volatility, and score pools on multi-dimensional risk/return metrics.

3. **Allocation & policy check**  
   - The allocation engine assigns capital per pool respecting global caps, per-pool limits, and user-defined exposure and drawdown constraints.

4. **Pre-flight validation**  
   - Enforce safety checks: slippage tolerances, fee budget verification, token whitelist, and RPC redundancy. Abort and notify on any failure.

5. **Execution & signing**  
   - Build transaction batches (deposit/stake/harvest). Signing is performed through secure channels: hardware wallet, wallet provider bridge, or remote signing endpoint. The host running the orchestration does not require direct access to plaintext private keys.

6. **Monitoring & maintenance**  
   - Continuously track position metrics and pool health. Trigger compounding, rebalancing, or exit flows according to configured triggers.

7. **Reconciliation & reporting**  
   - Reconcile on-chain receipts with internal records and archive event logs for audit and tax purposes.

## Security recommendations

- **Never embed or paste private keys.** Adopt wallet-adapter integrations (e.g., Phantom-compatible patterns), hardware signing, or remote signer services.
- **Use read-only data sources for discovery.** Limit write operations to verified RPC endpoints with explicit rate limits.
- **Run on hardened hosts.** Deploy on a machine with minimal exposure, up-to-date OS patches, and strict firewall policies.
- **Prefer ephemeral wallets during testing.** Use minimal funded wallets while validating behavior.
- **Use multi-signer or approval gates for high value operations.** Consider multisig or out-of-band human approvals for large allocations.
- **Keep auditable trails.** Ship logs and transaction receipts to secure, immutable storage for accountability.
- **Keep dependencies current.** Monitor security advisories for Solana, Raydium, and third-party libraries.

## Risk considerations

Automated yield farming introduces multiple risk vectors:

- Impermanent loss vs. holding
- Smart contract vulnerabilities or protocol exploits
- Token mint or governance risks (rug pulls)
- Oracles or price manipulation affecting LP valuations
- Network congestion leading to failed or delayed operations
- Operational misconfiguration or software bugs

Adopt conservative defaults, test exhaustively, and implement emergency withdrawal plans.

## Deployment & testing checklist

1. Execute unit and integration tests locally.
2. Run historical backtests across varying market conditions.
3. Operate in paper mode while connected to live data feeds.
4. Trial with an ephemeral wallet holding minimum capital.
5. Integrate a hardware wallet or remote signer for live operation.
6. Ramp allocations gradually and monitor metrics and alerts.
